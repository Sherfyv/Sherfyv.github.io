The origin of the 2.4 Hz seismic noise recorded by InSight remains unclear, with hypotheses including wind-induced friction, subsurface resonances, and instrument artifacts. Using machine learning, we analyze its correlation with environmental variables and identify wind speed and direction as the dominant factors. During strong southeasterly winds, the 2.4 Hz noise gradually blends into the background. During relatively mild wind from other directions, the 2.4 Hz signal increases faster with the background and becomes a strong anomaly, which is also observed during marsquakes. We propose that the 2.4 Hz anomaly originates from resonant vibrations of the lander or its components (e.g., solar panels) in response to external forces. Weak forcing highlights the resonance at 2.4 Hz, while stronger forcing saturates it, masking the anomaly. These findings point to the lander's structural resonance as the source of the 2.4 Hz noise, modulated by wind and seismic activity.
